excerpt: 'We show that countries with more stringent capital controls exhibit systematically smaller responses of interest rates to unanticipated changes in U.S. monetary policy. This is robust to controlling for other country characteristics, consideration of endogenous capital controls, and alternative measures of interest rates and policy shocks. Results are validated on a cross-country panel of firm-level stock returns. We find with similar robustness that countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes exhibit smaller interest rate responses to U.S. monetary policy shocks. Our results provide strong evidence that the constraints imposed by the classic Trilemma are present in the recent data.'
