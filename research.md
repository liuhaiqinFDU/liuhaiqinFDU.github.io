## Selected work in progress

<!--**Uncertainty Shocks and Monetary Policy Coordination** (with Charles Engel)-->

<!-- **Structural Monetary Policy, Quantitative Easing, and Collateral Constraints: A Tale of Two Central Banks** (*draft upon request*) -->

<!-- My research motivation is to develop a theory that captures the interaction and spillover effects of monetary policies between U.S. (Home) and China (Foreign). The model builds on [Geanakoplos & Wang (2020)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180484) (GW) and extends it to include the Foreign central bank's risky asset purchases -- in reality,  the PBC's Structural Monetary Policy (SMP). To make the PBC's asset purchase meaningful, I deviate from GW's original No-borrowing environment to assume Foreign as a Leverage Economy. Additionally, to generate persistent ``collateral gap'' in the free-trade equilibrium, one needs to assume more sophisticated financial system in the U.S. To make progress, I adopt the Tranching Economy setting of [Fostel, Geanakoplos & Phelan (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2921456). The nonlinear equation system is established and interaction effects between the Fed's QE and PBC's SMP are investigated. -->

<!-- **The Impossible Trinity, Monetary Policy Spillover, and Collateral Constraint** (*draft upon request*) -->

<!-- This paper studies Mundell-Fleming's impossible trinity in a two-country endogenous collateral equilibrium model with monetary policy. The Home country (thought of as U.S.) is a Tranching economy, with monetary authority engaging in risky asset purchases and free capital movements. The Foreign is a Leverage economy, with capital control (CC) tax imposed on international asset purchases (inflows or outflows), and nominal exchange rate intervened by the central bank (FXI). I study the implications on how CC and FXI affect the spillover effects of Home monetary policy to Foreign asset price, which is tested empirically in my capital control paper (Ha, Liu & Rogers, 2025). -->

- **The Excess Bond Premium and Monetary Policy Transmission in China** (with [Chenyu Mao](https://sites.google.com/view/chenyu-sophia-mao/home-page)) *[draft coming soon!]*

<!--*Abstract*: We construct the Excess Bond Premium (EBP) measure for China, a representative macro indicator of risk-bearing capacity of financial market. As a by-product, we infer micro-level external financing costs via firm-level EBP. Crucially, in the construction of distance-to-default, we follow the framework of Geng and Pan (2024) to adjust for the SOE premium. We then apply identification via fat-tailed distribution to identify Chinese monetary policy shocks, and investigate the heterogeneous transmission of multi-dimensional PBOC shocks, through the lens of the firm-level EBP. We document that transmission effects of conventional PBC shocks decline with the firm-level EBP, consistent with Ottonello and Winberry (2020), while the transmission effects of balance-sheet dimension of PBC shocks increase with firm-level EBP, as a novel new finding. -->

- **Global and Local Uncertainties in Small Open Economies** (with Sihao Chen, Shi Qiu)
  *Presented at MEG 2023\*, NASMES 2024\*,  IAAE 2024, ESWC 2025\**

<!-- **The Credit Surface and Monetary Policy in China** -->

<!-- The credit surface is a major concept proposed by [Geanakoplos (2016)](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9780262034623/ch015.xml), and has been proven to be crucial for monetary policy transmission. This research quantifies the credit surface in China, aiming to provide practical guidance for PBC's monetary policy and macroprudential implementation. -->
