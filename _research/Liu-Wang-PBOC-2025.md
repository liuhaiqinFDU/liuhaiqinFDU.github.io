excerpt: 'This paper delineates between the traditional and innovative monetary policy transmission in China, employing the high-frequency event to identify exogenous shocks of the PBOC. 
Monetary policy in China contains multiple dimensions. We consider traditional tools that include the interest rate and reserve requirement ratio adjustments, while innovative tools include interest rate liberalization and structural monetary policy, resulting from the dual-track interest rate system and credit misallocation in Chinese financial market.
We document that innovative monetary policy transmits more effectively on the term structure and risk premium compared with traditional tools like the interest rate and reserve requirement ratios. The pass-through of traditional monetary policy to firm activities is decreasing in financial constraints, while that of the innovative monetary policy is increasing in financial constraints. These empirical regularities are understood through the lens of "Credit Surface" (Geanakoplos, 2010). The practice of the PBOC directly tests the monetary policy footprint across the "credit surface", and calls for the central banks to pay attention to the whole "credit surface" instead of just riskfree interest rate.'
