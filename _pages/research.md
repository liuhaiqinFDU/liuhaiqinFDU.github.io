**1. Structural Monetary Policy, Quantitative Easing, and Collateral Constraints: A Tale of Two Central Banks**

My research motivation is to develop a theory that captures the interaction and spillover effects of monetary policies between U.S. (Home) and China (Foreign). The model builds on [Geanakoplos & Wang (2020)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180484) (GW) and extends it to include the Foreign central bank's risky asset purchases -- in reality,  the PBC's Structural Monetary Policy (SMP). To make the PBC's asset purchase meaningful, I deviate from GW's original No-borrowing environment to assume Foreign as a Leverage Economy. Additionally, to generate persistent ``collateral gap'' in the free-trade equilibrium, one needs to assume more sophisticated financial system in the U.S. To make progress, I adopt the Tranching Economy setting of [Fostel, Geanakoplos & Phelan (2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2921456). The nonlinear equation system is established and interaction effects between the Fed's QE and PBC's SMP are investigated.

**2. The Excess Bond Premium and Monetary Policy Transmission in China** (with [John Rogers](https://www.johnrogerseconomist.net/), Tonghe Zhang)

We construct the Excess Bond Premium (EBP) measure for China, offering a nuanced view of the evolving risk-bearing capacity in China's bond market. Leveraging the framework of [Ferreira, Ostry & Rogers (2022)](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2024/firm-financial-conditions-and-the-transmission-of-monetary-policy.pdf), we investigate the heterogeneous transmission of Chinese monetary policy shocks through the lens of the EBP, to provide insights into the differential impacts across firms with varying financial sensitivities.

**3. The Credit Surface and Monetary Policy in China**

The credit surface is a major concept proposed by [Geanakoplos (2016)](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9780262034623/ch015.xml), and has been proven to be crucial for monetary policy transmission. This research quantifies the credit surface in China, aiming to provide practical guidance for PBC's monetary policy and macroprudential implementation.
